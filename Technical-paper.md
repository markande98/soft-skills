# What is Caching?

#### Caching is a process that stores multiple copies of data and files in a temporary storage location and this location is known as a cache so that data or files can be accessed faster. Caching will help us serve more requests per second and save the precious resources.Cached data typically includes multimedia such as images, files, and scripts, which are automatically stored when a user visits a website and opens the application for the first time. This is used to quickly load the application and website's information every time when the user subsequently opens and visits it.
